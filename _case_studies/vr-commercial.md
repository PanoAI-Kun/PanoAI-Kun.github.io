# VR Binocular Vision & Commercial Pipeline Optimization

> **Commercial Impact**: 💰 **Reduced video encoding costs by 50%**
> **Academic Pedigree**: 📄 **IEEE TVCG (Tier A*)**

## 1. Core Technology: Depth Adaption for VR (TVCG)
In virtual reality, seamless image composition requires precise **Binocular Vision** handling. My research provides the underlying framework for:
* **Eliminating Visual Fatigue**: Solves the Vergence-Accommodation Conflict by optimizing depth consistency.
* **Universal Integration**: Serves as a foundational component for any AR/VR content insertion or augmentation.



## 2. Industrial Implementation: oVRcome Platform
I applied these computer vision principles to the **oVRcome** (VR Medical/Tech) production pipeline, focusing on high-scale automation:
* **Automated Pipeline**: Designed an end-to-end ETL and quality assessment workflow.
* **Scale**: Successfully processed **3,850+ minutes** of VR video content.
* **Economic ROI**: The system's efficiency directly resulted in a **50% reduction** in video encoding and conversion overhead.

## 3. Technical Summary
* **Pipeline Logic**: Data-driven optimization ensuring high-fidelity visual experience with minimal manual intervention.
* **Strategic Value**: Demonstrated that academic-grade AI models can be scaled to meet rigorous commercial cost-saving targets.
